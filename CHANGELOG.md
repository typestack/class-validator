### [0.14.0](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator/compare/v0.13.2...v0.14.0) (2022-12-09)

### Added

- add `@IsTimeZone` decorator to check if given string is valid IANA time zone
- add `@IsISO4217CurrencyCode` decorator to check if the string is an ISO 4217 currency code
- add `@IsStrongPassword` decorator to check if given password matches specific complexity criteria
- add `@IsBase58` decorator to check if a string is base58 encoded
- add `@IsTaxId` decorator to check if a given string is a valid tax ID in a given locale
- add support for passing function as date generator in `@MinDate` and `@MaxDate` decorators
- add option to print constraint error message instead of constraint type in validation error
- improve decorator metadata lookup performance
- return possible values in error message for `@IsEnum` decorator

### Fixed

- re-added `@types/validator` as dependency
- fix error generation when using `@NestedValidation`
- pass validation options correctly to validator in `@IsDateString` decorator
- support passing `Symbol` as parameter in error message generation
- specify supported locales for `@IsAlphanumeric` decorator
- correctly assign decorator name in metadata instead of loosing it
- fix various spelling errors in documentation
- fix various spelling errors and inconsistencies in JSDoc for decorators

### Changed

- enable `forbidUnknownValues` option by default
- remove documentation about deprecated schema based validation and added warning
- update warning message logged about missing decorator metadata
- update `libphonenumber-js` to `^1.10.14` from `^1.9.43`
- update various dev-dependencies

### BREAKING CHANGES

**`forbidUnknownValues` option is enabled by default**

From this release the `forbidUnknownValues` is enabled by default. This is the desired behavior for majority of
use-cases, but this change may break validation for some. The two scenarios that results in failed validation:

- when attempting to validate a class instance without metadata for it
- when using group validation and the specified validation group results in zero validation applied

The old behavior can be restored via specifying `forbidUnknownValues: false` option when calling the validate functions.

For more details see [PR #1798](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator/pull/1798) and [#1422 (comment)](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator/issues/1422#issuecomment-1317953863).

**`@NestedValidation` decorator correctly assigns validation errors**

Until now the errors from a nested validation in some cases were incorrectly assigned
to the parent instead of the child being validated. Now the validation errors are correctly assigned.

For more details see [#679](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator/issues/679).

##### Added

- updated [validator.js][validator-js] from 7.0.0 to 9.2.0 (Check it's [changelog][validator-js-release-notes] for what has changed.)

  This caused breaking change, if you used the `IsUrl` decorator to validate `localhost` as a valid url, from now you must use the `require_tld: false` option

  ```typescript
  @IsUrl({ require_tld: false})
  url: string;
  ```

- added `@IsInstance` decorator and `validator.isInstance(value, target)` method.
- changed `@IsNumber` decorator has been changed to `@IsNumber(options: IsNumberOptions)`
- added option to strip unknown properties \(`whitelist: true`\)
- added option to throw error on unknown properties \(`forbidNonWhitelisted: true`\)

### 0.6.5

#### Fixed

- added `@ValidateIf` decorator, see conditional validation in docs.

### 0.5.0 \[BREAKING CHANGE\]

#### Added

- async validations must be marked with `{ async: true }` option now.

  This is optional, but it helps to determine which decorators are async to prevent their execution in `validateSync` method.

- added `validateSync` method that performs non asynchronous validation and ignores validations that marked with `async: true`.
- there is a breaking change in `registerDecorator` method. Now it accepts options object.
- breaking change with `@ValidatorConstraint` decorator. Now it accepts option object instead of single name.

- added support of separate validation schemas
- added support of default validation messages
- added support of special tokens in validation messages
- added support of message functions in validation options
- added support of custom decorators

### 0.3.0

#### Added

- package has changed its name from `validator.ts` to `class-validator`.
- sanitation functionality has been removed from this library. Use [class-sanitizer][class-sanitizer] instead.
